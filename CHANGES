SME structure:
    - Python Class object
    - Can read IDL sav files, but not write, uses numpy npy format instead
    - fitresult values in fitresult object
    - idlver still called that, but contains information about Python version

Abundance:
    - Python Class object
    - set of two default solar abundances
    - can output abundances in different formats
    - internal format is 'H=12', i.e. log(X/H) + 12

Synthetic Spectrum:
    - sme_func, gives almost the same results as in IDL
    - there are slight differences in the interpolation of the atmospheres
    - relative differences < 1e-6 (?)

Solver:
    - Switched solving algorithm to use scipy.optimize.least_squares with method="trf"
    - Method "trf" = Trust-region Reflective
    - also includes bounds, but only for the outer edges of the atmosphere grid
    - will find different minima than IDL SME, but within a reasonable range and often with slightly better chi square
